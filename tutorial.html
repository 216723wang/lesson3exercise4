      <h1>Basic P5.js setup</h1>
      <p>
        This project sets up a "hello world" (ok draw a circle) program using p5.js.  It includes all the files you will need to produce a p5.js sketch without needing to add anything extra.  It even include the addons for p5.js
      </p>


      <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Type your sketch into the file called sketch.js
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't need p5.dom.js  or p5.sound.js you can delete them using the file explorer on the left
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do plan to use them, move each of the pieces you want to use below <code>line 8</code> in the file <b>index.html</b> (this is the end comment line
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to rename the sketch.js file, please remember to change the script tag in index.html
        </li>
        <li>NOTE: for outside media (graphics, sounds, video) resource, host your media and provide a url instead of uploading to your thimble project</li>
